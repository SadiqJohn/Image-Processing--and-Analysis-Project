# Homework 2 - Image Processing and Analysis in MATLAB

## Overview
This project extends image processing capabilities with additional techniques like upsampling, zigzag scanning, and color analysis using MATLAB.

### Files
- **`HW2.m`**: MATLAB script with multiple image processing implementations.
- **`upsample.m`**: Custom function for upsampling images.
- **`zigzag.m`**: Implements zigzag scanning of matrices.
- **`a1.png` and `a2.png`**: Output images generated during the tasks.
- **`Original.png`**: Input image used for transformations.
- **`Flooded_house.jpg`**: Additional image for optional tasks.
- **`Compe565_HW2.pdf`**: Original assignment instructions.
- **`HW2 Report.docx`**: Report explaining results and methodology.

### Key Tasks
1. **Image Upsampling**:
   - Increase image resolution using a custom function.
2. **Matrix Zigzag Scanning**:
   - Traverse matrices in a zigzag order, commonly used in image compression.
3. **Color Channel Analysis**:
   - Further explore red, green, and blue channel properties.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Custom function development in MATLAB.
- Matrix traversal and manipulation.
- Advanced image processing concepts.

## How to Use
1. Open `HW2.m` in MATLAB.
2. Ensure all image files (`a1.png`, `a2.png`, `Original.png`) are in the same directory.
3. Run the script, following the task sections to observe outputs.
