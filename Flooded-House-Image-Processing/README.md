# Homework 1 - Image Processing and MATLAB Tutorial

## Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental image processing techniques and MATLAB scripting concepts. The tasks involve working with an image of a flooded house, processing its color channels, and analyzing its components.

### Files
- **`HW1.m`**: MATLAB script implementing various image processing tasks.
- **`Flooded_house.jpeg`**: Sample image used for processing.
- **`COMPE 565 HW1.pdf`**: Original assignment instructions.
- **`Schematic_Walkthrough_-_SEA-330_Amplifier_Test_Fixture.docx`**: Additional reference material.
- **`Matlab Tutorial`**: Supporting resources for learning MATLAB.

### Key Tasks
1. **Display Original Image**:
   - Load and visualize the input image using MATLAB.
2. **Extract and Analyze Color Channels**:
   - Isolate red, green, and blue channels.
   - Reconstruct grayscale images for each channel.
3. **Image Manipulation**:
   - Apply basic operations to analyze and transform the image.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Image loading and visualization.
- Matrix manipulation for color channel extraction.
- MATLAB scripting and debugging.
