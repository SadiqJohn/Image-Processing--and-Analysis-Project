# Image Processing Project - Flooded House Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates fundamental image processing techniques using MATLAB. The project uses a sample image, "Flooded_house.jpeg," to apply various operations such as extracting color channels, manipulating pixel data, and analyzing image components.

### Features
1. **Display Original Image**:
   - Load and visualize a sample image.
   - Add custom titles to displayed figures.

2. **Color Channel Extraction**:
   - Isolate individual color bands (Red, Green, and Blue) from the image.
   - Reconstruct and visualize each band as separate grayscale images.

3. **Image Analysis** (if applicable in other parts of the script):
   - Perform basic pixel-level operations.
   - Analyze image components for visualization or further processing.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Image Manipulation**:
  - Reading and displaying images in MATLAB.
  - Extracting and reconstructing individual color channels.
- **Matrix Operations**:
  - Handling image data as matrices.
  - Constructing and manipulating RGB color bands using matrix concatenation.
- **MATLAB Programming**:
  - Using built-in MATLAB functions for image processing (`imread`, `imshow`, `cat`).
  - Structuring reusable code with modular sections for specific tasks.
