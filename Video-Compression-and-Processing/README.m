## How to Use
1. Place all files in the same directory.
2. Open MATLAB and load the desired script (e.g., `encode.m`, `decode.m`).
3. Run the functions in the correct sequence:
   - Encode the video using `encode.m`.
   - Analyze or decode the video using other scripts (e.g., `decode.m`).

## Future Directions
- Implement advanced compression standards (e.g., H.264 or HEVC).
- Extend motion estimation to support sub-pixel accuracy.
- Add graphical output for better visualization of motion vectors and compressed frames.
